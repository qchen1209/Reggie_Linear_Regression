# Reggie_Linear_Regression

Correlation between the bounciness of different balls and ball pit in the play .\
Use loops, lists, and arithmetic to create a function that will find a line of best fit when given a set of data.

Part 1: Calculating Error\
Create a function that can take in a line and Reggie's data and return how much error that line produces when we try to fit it to the data.

Part 2: Try a bunch of slopes and intercepts\
Try a bunch of different slopes and a bunch of different intercepts and find the smallest error value for his dataset.

Part 3: What does our model predict?\
Use the model to predict the bounce of all kinds of sizes of balls Reggie may choose to include in the ball pit
